# 📊 Time Series Analysis Notebooks

Welcome to my **Time Series Analysis** repository! 🚀  

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks where I explore and implement various **time series analysis** concepts. It is not a full-fledged project but rather a **learning space** where I experiment with different techniques and datasets to deepen my understanding of time series forecasting, decomposition, and modeling.

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered

In these notebooks, I explore a variety of **time series techniques**, including but not limited to (Some concepts listed are TBD):

- ✅ **Time Series Decomposition** (Trend, Seasonality, Residuals)  
- ✅ **Stationarity & Differencing** (Dickey-Fuller Test, ACF/PACF)  
- ✅ **Smoothing Techniques** (Moving Averages, Exponential Smoothing)  
- ✅ **Classical Forecasting Models** (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA)  
- ✅ **Machine Learning for Time Series** (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- ✅ **Deep Learning for Time Series** (LSTMs, CNNs, Transformers)  
- ✅ **Anomaly Detection** (Outlier detection in time series)  

Each notebook contains explanations, code implementations, and insights gained from different datasets.

## 📊 Datasets Used

I experiment with different time series datasets, including:

- Stock market data
- Ice Cream Production Data

Datasets may either be sourced from **public repositories** (Kaggle, UCI, etc.) or self-generated.
